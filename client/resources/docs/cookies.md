We use technologies on this website to collect information that helps us improve your online experience. In this Cookie Policy, we refer to these technologies (which include cookies, pixels, web beacons and gifs) collectively as cookies.

Please take a look at the last effective date at the top of this page to see when this Cookie Policy was last revised. Any changes in this Cookie Policy will become effective when we make the revised Cookie Policy available on or through the Site.

Where applicable, we provide you with the opportunity to opt out. We hope that this Cookie Policy helps you understand, and feel more confident about, our use of cookies.

# What is a cookie?

Cookies are small text files that are stored on your computer or mobile device. They are widely used in order to make websites work, or work in a better, more efficient way. They can do this because websites can read and write these files, enabling them to recognize you and remember important information that will make your use of a website more convenient (e.g. by remembering your user preferences).

# Cookie Usage

We do NOT track and sell your data to third-parties. We only use cookies for 2 things:

**Account Sessions**: Used for logging into user accounts, for accessing any user preferences for browsing, and for caching data locally for offline access. These are technical cookies (such as preference cookies, session cookies, load balancing, etc.) strictly necessary for the provision of the service. We believe that these are considered “consent-exempt” cookies pursuant to GDPR regulations, and therefore are not subject to preventive blocking.

**Protection against Abusive traffic** We utilize hCaptcha to detect abusive traffic on our website without user interaction. Per the hCaptcha cookie policy, the creators of hCaptcha:

> _“believe the hCaptcha anti-bot service (i.e. the Service embedded by websites, games, or mobile apps) includes only so-called "consent-exempt" cookies pursuant to GDPR regulations. Examples of such exempt cookies include:_
>
> - _Technical cookies strictly necessary for the provision of the service. These include preference cookies, session cookies, load balancing cookies, etc._
> - _Statistical cookies managed directly by us (i.e. first party, not third-party cookies), where the data is not used for profiling.”_

# What Information is Collected About Me
