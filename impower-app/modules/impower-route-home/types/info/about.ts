    `The video game industry is one of the world's most popular creative industries, but also one of the most difficult to break into. Many potential indie developers feel overwhelmed, believing they must become superhuman solo developers who can do everything (art, writing, music, programming) all on their own. Others feel trapped working in large studios infamous for unreasonable crunch, frequent layoffs, toxic work-culture, and employee abuse. These barriers to entry decrease industry diversity and discourage many people from attempting to become game developers.`,
    `We at Impower believe that there is another way forward for the game industry.`,
    `Our mission is to drastically lower the barrier to entry for game development and improve the diversity and accessibility of the industry as a whole. By doing this, we hope to counteract many of the problematic aspects of the game industry today: taking power out of the hands of big studios and putting it back in the hands of the creative individuals who work everyday to make the games we love.`,
